	<h1>A Visit to a Zoo</h1>

		<p>Last Sunday it was cloudy. I along with my friends visited the zoo. As we reached near the main gate of the zoo, we saw a huge crowd. Some were buying entrance tickets, some were gossiping and chatting other were relaxing under the shady trees.

We entered to zoological garden and came across a beautiful lake in which some water-birds like ducks were swimming. Seeing the white ducks on the smooth surface of water is a charming sight. As we moved, we came to the enclosure in which flying birds (fowls) were kept. They ranged from sparrows, eagles and parrots to pigeons of various colours. The birds were chirping. It was an enchanting music. We enjoyed it very much.

In the next enclosure were kept-lions and leopards tigers and tigresses, whose roarings were deafening. We approached the net, a lion rushed towards us and we were frightened. Their fierce looks were frightening for us. After seeing this, we came across a garden in which stags very smart and beautiful. In one of the corners monkeys were jumping. Their tricks and pranks were very pleasing. Some people threw food grains to them and they immediately jumped down the trees in order to eat them. Some children were making faces at them.

Our next halt was at an acquarium in which we were most interested. A large number of the fishes were kept there. There were fish of many species and colours. To see them fidgeting in water was really a delightful spectacle. There were many other acquatic animals. Just by the side of this enclosure we came across polar bears who looked sad and deserted.

It was the place of black bear which attracted a mammoth gathering. The bear was playing many tricks which thrilled the spectators. Some people offered him eatables which he gulped at once.

The zoological parks are so vast that it is very difficult to describe all the departments and enclosures fully. When we took a complete round of the zoo, we relaxed for some time in a cool and beautiful garden inside the zoo. The fragrance of the flawers was tremendously soothing. Then we had some snacks and drinks which refreshed us much. It was evening and the sun was setting. We came out of the zoo like many other visitors. We boarded the bus while casting our last and side by the old but majestic wallof the old fort, which, no doubt, added to the beauty and grandeur of the zoo.
