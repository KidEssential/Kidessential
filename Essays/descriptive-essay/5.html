	<h1>A Rainy Day</h1>

		<p>This year the summer season was unduly long and extremely hot. It was July, the schools had reopened. The scorching sun and the extreme heat had made life unbearable. Going to the school, studying in the class or playing on the ground all seemed to be a punishment. One morning, clouds gathered in the sky. There were vivid flashes of lightning. Suddenly it started raining. There was a downpour for a short while but soon it turned into a steady raining. It was time for school. So, we took our umbrellas and set out.

It was refreshing to go out in the cool air. Every one and every thing looked fresh. The trees looked green. The sound of falling rain was pleasing to the ears. Not one minded the inconvenience of wet umbrellas, soaking shoes and wet clothes.

The plight of bus travelers was of course pitiable. Buses were late and overcrowded. It may be quite pleasant to take a brisk walk in the rain, nobody likes standing in the queue in wet clothes with the drops from other personsâ€™ umbrellas dropping down the back with cold clammy frequency.

The street urchins were having a great time playing in the streets, floating boats on the sides of the roads where water was flowing fast. I wished I could join them.

In the class, very few student were attentive. Almost everybody was looking out and watching rain every now and then. Primary class children were playing with boats in the pool which serves our center court. Water had gathered there. 

Our school gate and the road had ankle deep water. The municipality had been caught napping. The drainage system was choked. All low lying areas had knee deep water.

It is exhilarating to watch pouring rain and to run about in it. But soon I was happy to return home and change wet clothes.
