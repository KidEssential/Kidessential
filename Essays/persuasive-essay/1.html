	<h1>Democracy and Its Needs</h1>
		<p>
		'Democracy,' defines Bernard Shaw, 'is a social order aiming at the greatest available welfare for the whole population and not for a class.' Democracy has many merits. Freedom and equality are its essential concepts. That is to say, there should exist respect for the individual as the supreme motive of power.

Perfect democracy can be achieved by educating all people in a country. People should be made to realise their social and political responsibilities. They should have a complete knowledge of democratic living and democratic from of government. Constant vigilance is the price of democracy.

The success of democracy largely depends on its power to produce the right type of leadership. The things to come are determined by the thinking, value and beliefs of these leaders. They should be conscious about the essence of democracy.

Freedom of expression and a well motivated public opinion through an impartial media will help to achieve effective democratic value. people should be more active and vigilant in the democratic form of government, since it is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

Other essence are recognition of the rights of minority, uniform justice throughout the country to citizens to have a right to fight for justice etc.

Holding free and impartial election ensures democracy in true sense. To achieve all these essentials a basic economic independence of all citizen is a must for democracy.
