	<h1>Serving the sick and injured</h1>
		<p>
		Under the Socially Useful productive Works, our class has been assigned two duties. The boys are sent for Traffic Control while the girls are posted to a hospital ward, to serve the sick and the injured.

My turn also came to be sent to the General Ward of the queens Hospital. We reached there around 8.30 a.m. the doctors were to come at 9 sharp, so we all spread ourselves, as deputed, in the Ward.

Five of us were posted at the Reception and the Inquiry Counter to direct the patients to the various cabins, in which a nurse or doctor was waiting for them. There, they were given a Patients Card each, which was to be given Jump to the doctor examining them. We help the patients and the injured to form queues, and to report to the doctor, one by one. In spite of that, some patients with the connivance of the hospital staff managed to jump the queues or come by the back door and see the doctor on duty. The doctors also appeared to the helpless in these cases.

Another ten students were spread in the Ward. Each one of them had on an average 4-5 beds. They helped them in an orderly arrangement of their beds, medicines, cupboards and personal belongings.

Six of us were on duty at the Dispensary. There, we helped in the proper delivery of the pills, mixtures and capsules. The people were keen to crowd at the counters. But the compounder appeared to be a tough guy. He did not allow any one to come near his counter unless he himself called the names or Patient Card numbers.

Four students were stationed at the injection table. Two were controlling the crowd, helping the formation of the queue, and allowing them one by one, and the others were inside the cabin at the injection table, helping the doctor, the nurse and the patient after the injection.

Three students were at the cycle and scooter stand helping the patients and their relatives and friends in locating their vehicles after their visits to the hospital wards and after being discharged from there. One could notice a feeling of joy and relief writ large on their faces.

Thus, the whole of our class was put in the SUPW periods in that hospital. This served as a great experience, in the day to day works around us. Our education would not remain bookish and far fetched. But it would be useful to the society and productive and that is what we mean by Socially Useful Productive Work.
