	<h1>Effect of Crime Stories</h1>
		<p>
		Detective stories tend to glorify crimes. Murderers, gangsters and crooks are always shown tough, cunning and courageous who get on with their job for a considerable time. Movies are greatly responsible to make many people take the path of crime by making crimes attractive. Police are shown as stupid and slow and civil characters shine by contrast. Many bank robberies and museum thefts of valuables article were being planned and executed after the fashion of movies and crime thrillers.

Newspapers give glorious detail of a murder or suicide with the details of drugs and methods used the killers or the victims. The media has a moral duty towards its public. Giving attractive headlines, or publishing false information, to create an alarm among its readers, are to be curbed. Yellow journalism will never appeal to the baser instincts of people.

Text books are there to nurture value among the young minds. It is surprising after spending a lot of money, human energy and intelligence, the choice of lessons is so poor.

For example the villain is presented as an attractive character casual, brave, smart and successful with women. It is true that he finally gets caught. The whole lesson will deal glorifying the quick success of an immoral character. The events and situation will impress the reader and he might conclude that the life of crime is worth risking. Terrorists grow in our thoughts with a 'Halo' of glory, as we are unable to stop their mindless killings. Is glorifying crimes is not a crime?
