	<h1>The Real Education</h1>
		<p>
		The thoughts and knowledge of one generation pass to another and they pass through the child. What is education for? Why do we build schools and take much trouble to examine children in what they have learned? The child goes to school to learn the true riches of life like love for the humanity, thinking or reasoning and acting according to the situation. Education is the growth of human mind. A workman of ivory spends a long time in learning the skill of carving ivory. Educating a child is carving thoughts and feelings in his mind. It is a great art to contact the heart of child and build good character with lasting effect.

To my mind, real education is to make a child live for others, always acting just and lindly. He should grow into a good citizen, with a great admiration for everything good in life. He should know how to preserve his ancient glories and treasure them as national pride. He should be taught to think before he acts, to be prudent and useful to his society. He should develop values of heart, like courage, patriotism, sympathy, service mindedness, loyalty, cooperation and tolerance to make his country noble. Education should teach the young minds to do useful service in their trade or profession to manifest the power or work in the human brain and the human hand.
