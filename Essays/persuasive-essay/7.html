	<h1>Value of Games</h1>
		<p>
		All work and no play makes Jak a dull boy" is an old saying. Physical fitness is a condition for mental alertness. Good health is the greatest blessing of God. Healthy persons can think properly, act promptly and work peristently. And in the present day world work is the only way to success. An unhealthy person will remain unhappy and dispirited. Games keep us physically fit.

In all the games some rules must be followed. Those who play foul are not allowed to play. If rules of the game are not observed gameswill no longer remain the civilised activities of human beings. Games make us disciplined in thinking and in actions. And discipline among the members of the society is of the greatest value. Our animal instincts are brought under control.

Games teach us the team spirit. We must play as a team; individual game spoils the chances of victory. Every player cooperates with other player in defeating the other side. If we develop this very team spirit in our daily life perhaps most of the problems of the world will be solved.

While playing one hasto obey the captain. In the field, the player is not supposed to dispute the decion of the captain. If the players start disobeying the captain, there will be anarchy in the field. In life, if we obey parents at home, teachers at schools and laws of the land, the world will be better.

The possibility of defeat should not unnerve us. Sometimes we fear failure. We forget if 'hopes are dups, fears may be biars.' Moreover defeat should not disappoint us. Games teach us the way to face failure which we come across atadversary corner.
