	<h1>Home Life and Hostel Life</h1>
		<p>
		Marks came home during the Autumn Break for about a week, and met his friends whom he had not been able to meet during thae last 2-3 months, as he was staying in the hostal. He was daily surrounded by them, as they were also equally keen to learn from him about his new experiences at the college as well as the playground.

One day one of his friends expressed a wish to be in a hostal, whereupon Marks had to remark that he was not right, in wishing for the hostal life and that their home life was far better than the hostel life. He had various points in support of his belief. These are some of the important arguments put forward by him.

Early in the morning, when one gets up from the bed, one finds either or mother, or some brother, sister or other near and dear one in a home, while in the hostel it is the same room-mate or a bearer carrying a tray with cups, full of cold tea being served, while one is in bed. You feel like greeting your parents or other, while in a hostal you are terribly annoyed with the servants disturbing your sleep, early in the morning.

Then for cleaning, sweeping or for your meals, you have to struggle a lot, as no one appears to be the least bothered about you, or your friends. There, every thing is so stereotyped.

In the evening also you generally do not get your hot cup of milk, coffee or tea, or you have to remind the servant, day in and day out for your share of meals.

One misses the home life most in a hostel, especially on the eve of festivals, as it is not always possible to go home during every vacation, big or small. The friends and relatives are missed the most.

Whether it is meals or sleep, games or study, cleanliness or comfort, home life is better than hostel life.
