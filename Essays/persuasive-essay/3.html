	<h1>Discipline Around Us</h1>
		<p>
		Be she a teacher, a preacher or a leader, invariable in speech one exhorts the audience to developing discipline in every walk of life. But how many of us really observe discipline. Step out of your door and you are faced with indiscipline.

At the bus stop, there is seldom a queue and if there is one, those who are in row are the worst casualties because the protagonists of indiscipline push them aside and get into the bus under one or the other pretext.

Go to a cinema house and try to buy a ticket from the booking window, you would be only disappointed. Pay some premium and despite a full-house board hanging at the entrance, you have a ticket from the black market.

The list of those who violate discipline runs into several pages and it would be an exercise in futility to recount and name them all. Let us only understand the importance of discipline from the following thought provoking question and if convinced of the utility and usefulness of discipline, let us take a vow from today to observe discipline of every sort.

What would happen if the pilots flying the plane break the rules of discipline and the army personnel refuse to obey their superiors and the transporters drive and stop their vehicles at their own whims and caprices and what would happen if mother stop feeding their young ones and the producers stop their production and suppliers their supplies and the distributors stop all distribution of articles of our every day use. 

There would be chaos and nobody would be able to live or even exist peacefully. The whole human ace would be in chaos.
