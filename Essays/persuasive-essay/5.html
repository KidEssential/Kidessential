	<h1>Life In A Big City</h1>
		<p>
		I went to Singapore to spend my summer holidays with my uncle. He stays in Queen Street, a very busy and crowded area of Singapore. I was surprised to see the activities people throughout the day.

As live in a hamlet near Mali, I had no idea that life would be like this in a crowded city. In my hamlet I was an early riser. Here instead of the songs of birds, I heard the cries of hawkers and vehicles. Singapore sleeps at one O'clock after midnight and the new days starts at four O'clock in the morning. Everywhere so much of noise is there and the people have grown insensitive and are not affected by this.

I went to the neighbour's house to play with his children. I was informed by the parents that their children would never get time to play. Early morning they go to school and come back tired in the evening. Preparation for next day's school work takes more time and very rarely do they go out in the open air to play.

In our hamlet, things are quite different. Natural surroundings, good water, fresh air and relaxed lifestyle give us energy and make life more enjoyable. There is absolute peace without the noise of motor horns and hawkers. People are simple, love each other and enjoy life like one big family. Of coures, There are no modern amenities like transport, hospitals, school etc.

I was thinking to visit a suburb of Singapore. My uncle took me to the station to board an electric train. The trains were moving very fast and people were travelling, hanging by the bars of the foot-boards.

The scene was frightening and I had no courage to get inside the train at all. I felt safe and confident when I went Jump to my hamlet.
