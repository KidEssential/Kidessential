	<h1>How to Managing a House</h1>
		<p>
		At night, when I return to bed , I really repent for having been born eldest.

Mother is important member of the house. With out his life is impossible. One get frustrated doing all work., that is done by her. My mother has going for a week?s time, and I am managing the house now. It is simply a tough time, doing this job. I have to be so punctual, so regular and so perfect in my duties, that even if I miss by razor?s edge, things go topsy-turvy.

Every morning I have get up at 5 a.m., get my younger brother ready for school, pack his lunch. Next at 8.30, my younger sister leaves for her school. I have to get her dressed up, serve her meal, pack her lunch, and drop her at school.

My father, who leaves for the office at 9 a.m., starts dressing up at 8 a.m. I have to run back from her school, give breakfast to daddy and help him in many ways, like giving his handkerchief, polishing his shoes, and packing lunch.

After my father leaves, I have to dress up for school. I get so frustrated that I hardly take bath or eat breakfast.

I now realize the importance of my mother. I feel so sorry for having sometimes made faces at her. Managing a household is a big responsibility. I would hate to do that. In the evenings also I have to again cook meals, make coffee for my dad, serve food and so on.
