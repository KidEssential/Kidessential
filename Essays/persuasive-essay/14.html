	<h1>The Incident I Will Never Forget</h1>
		<p>Childhood is very impressionable age. One incident of my childhood is indelibly printed in my mind. I was eleven years old. I had just joined middle school. The children of primary school did not admit me in their company and those of middle school didnâ€™t wanted to be friends with me. They treated me as an outsider. To add insult to injury they often befooled me and made me a target of their jokes. No wonder I got into the habit of visiting the nearby orchard for solitude and incidentally stealing fruit. 

Once I got into the orchard and climbed up a huge mango tree. The owner saw me, and unnoticed by me put a toy dog looking like a real dog at the foot of that tree. After eating to the fill and filling my pockets with mangoes. I thought of getting down it was then that my eyes fell on a dog. My blood ran cold. I waited and waited for the dog to go but it remained there. Deciding to face the consequences of my theft. I jumped down. 

Imagine my surprise when I found that the dog which had frightened me to the bone was just a stuffed one. I started laughing helplessly at myself. The owner heard me. I was caught. He was a kind man. On my begging forgiveness, he let me go with just a word of advice. Can I ever forget this incident?.
