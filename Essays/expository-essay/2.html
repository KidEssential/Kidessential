		<p>Of all the recreations that men indulge in, a morning walk is the most rewarding. The air is fresh and free of dust and smoke. In cities like Tokyo it is only at this time that the roads are not crowded. There is hardly any traffic. One can enjoy the walk. As one walks, the worries and anxieties vanish away. The feet stride out in a joyful rhythm. The sheer delight of movement is enough to make the day. 

In the morning the nature is at its best. The dew-drops on lush green grass and leaves of plants look like pearls. The flowers laden with dew merrily wave their heads and spread their fragrance. So much color is splashed on all eyes and ears on such sights and sounds. 

A walk in a big park or on the bank of a stream is even more refreshing. The charm is enhanced many folds. 

The morning walk invigorates body system. It tones up the whole system. It prepares a man for the dayâ€™s work.
