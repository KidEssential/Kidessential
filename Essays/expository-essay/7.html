	<h1>The World of Colours</h1>

		<p>Colour has been an inseparable part of man's existence from times immemorial. When colour enlivens our environment, depression drifts away. Bright colours work on our moods and bring good vibrations. Small children if put in a grey-walled room start coughing and aneezing as the colour has a gloomy effect on them.

Nature is full with colours. Our body gets ultra-violet and infra-red treatment from sunlight. To get a feast of colours we should go to a well kept park. Flowers of different colours: pink, yellow violet, set against green and olive give a comforting effect to tired minds. The beauty of coloured dress (in a circus or dance show) in movement brings relief from the monotony of everyday life.

Colours in a person's attire reflect his personality. With a good colour sense one can bring joy into one's environment. All our festivals are colour oriented. We decorate our houses with banana and mango leaves and prepare sweets with different colour and believe thjat they have a divine aura, which affects our fortunes. In Astronomy and Astrology, it is believed, plants emit colourful cosmic rays which influence our health, happiness and wisdoms. Ancient Indian medicines prescribe cosmic colours to bring equilibrium in human cells. Physical and psychological defects are cured by colour therapy.

Literature glorifies colour around us. A world without the green fields, the blue sky, the gold of the sun and the pink of the roses will be dull. Nature has its own scheme of colours for sustenance and renewal of its rhythm and cycle.
