		<p>Each generation of men dies but its thoughts and knowledge that pass from age to age and faithfully kept. We have today the great epics in the form of scriptures and literature. Books are cultural objects and our minds are moulded by the books we read. Young minds acquire knowledge and wisdoms by reading great books.

In this age of conflict and cultural crisis, mankind should use all its intellectual wealth available, to overcome the maladies. Plenty of reading material of world culture should be available to all world communities. If we want to train our nations to think it terms of the welfare of humanity as a whole, we should encourage people to read more. Bookfairs are organised in all important countries to make the public aware of the new frontiers of knowledge.

Book-fairs bring the authors and readers close to each other. Great masterpiece and rare books are sold at concessional rates. By making it attractive, a book-fair creates an awareness in those who don't read habitually. Parents and teachers should insist upon children to read more books.

A visit to a book-fair will give them an insight into the world of intellectual power. To make the growing unity of world possible, development of psychological health is essential. Book-fair can contribute in bringing harmony among different cultures and encorage goodwill and tolerance.
