	<h1>The Man Who Inspired Me</h1>

		<p>Can I ever forget the octogenarian who stayed with us for two days. He was a tall frail looking man who commanded respect. He had immense patience and strove for perfection in everything.

He was sent to say in our house to avoid the hustle and bustle-the crowd and noise due to a wedding in our neighbor’s house. My mother had agreed to have him, as she was confident to give him a calm and peaceful atmosphere in our house. But to and behold, my sister arrived with her boisterous and rowdy kids for a week.

My mother got up early in the morning to give milk to the kids before they start screaming. Mr. Joseph was up, mother offered him tea. As she was having tea with him, the kids came crowding in. They fired questions after questions. He calmly sat there answering their questions with such a patience that I was flabbergasted. I would have, by that time been exasperated and brushed them away. 

They asked him to make on thing after another. He not only made the thing but also strove for perfection. I could not help but ask, why he was taking such pains. It would tire him. Moreover, the children were bound to destroy these things in no time. He said to me in no uncertain terms, “young one, never be sloppiesh. Nothing that has to be done, can be so trivial, as to do it sloppishly. Whatever, you undertake to do, put in effort and do it to the best of your ability” 

Even now when I do some thing carelessly, his words echo in my ears, He inspired me to take paints in everything I do. I hope I will at least be half a perfectionist, as he is.
