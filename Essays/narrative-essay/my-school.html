		<p>I study in Cambridge School which is one of the best schools of London. It has a stone building. It has all facilities a good school should have-well furnished classrooms, laboratories, library and playground. 

As we enter the school, there is a playground to our left and a small garden to our right. When we enter the building, the Principal’s room and the office room are to the left and the staff room to the right side. These are well furnished. There are thirty four classrooms. Our labs are well equipped. Our library has books almost on all subjects. Our Librarian is also very helpful.

Our school, like all schools, has a prescribed uniform. We have to wear white or cream cotton shirts, light-blue trousers, black shoes and white socks. Girls have to wear white blouses and light-blue skirts in primary and middle classes and white shirts and light-grey skirts in higher classes. They have to tie white ribbon also.

In our school special attention is paid to behavior, cleanliness and punctuality. The most well behaved, neat and punctual student is awarded a prize at the Annual Day function. 

Our Principle is a strict disciplinarian. He takes the help of P. T. Teachers too. If any one violates the rules, and is not in uniform, or makes mischief, he gets punished. But he is fair and loving. He tries to find out the reason and guides us. 

Our teachers are also quite strict. They teach us with great care, check our note-books, help us when we need but if we are inattentive and don’t work properly, then we are punished. 

I like my school very much and I am proud that I belong to it. I shall never forget it.
