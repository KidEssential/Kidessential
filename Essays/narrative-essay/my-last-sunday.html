	<h1>My Last Sunday</h1>

		<p>Sundays generally have a fixed routine for the TV programs. But last Sunday was different. On Monday I had two papers-English and Mathematics. Due to unavoidable circumstances, I had not been able to do any revision. So, I had planned in detail how I would revise both subjects that day.

I had planned to get up early and had set alarm clock to wake me up, but I got up very late. I had to skip through my lessons in English to make up for the lost time. I was not really worried, as I felt I knew it. 

After breakfast, I started revising Maths. I got stuck in the third problem. I was still trying to solve it when my uncle came with his family. I had to go to the market. When I returned, I learnt that the maid had not come. My sister was busy helping mother in the kitchen. So, I had to help in lying table, doing odd jobs and entertaining my uncle and cousins. I was free, only when they left at 5 p.m. 

I went to my room and bolted the door, so that I could study undisturbed. By the time I really settled down there was a breakdown of electricity. I was very upset. Mother advised me to go to sleep and promised to wake me up, as soon as the electricity came. As there was no current till late at night, all went to sleep.When I got up, it was almost 5 Oâ€™clock. The lights were on in all the rooms. I became worried and went round to see what the matter was. I found every one sound asleep. I tried to sit and study but I was so angry and anxious that I could not concentrate. Anyway, it was to get up and get ready.

Thus, the whole of the last Sunday was wasted. I could neither watch TV and enjoy, nor study.
