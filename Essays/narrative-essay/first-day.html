	<h1>First Day at School</h1>

		<p>This is my third school yet on the day I joined it was very nervous. We had shifted to Singapore recently and so I had to change to this school.

This school is very different from my previous one. It has a very grand and imposing building. There are big playgrounds on two sides and a beautiful garden in front. I was very happy to come to this school and had visions of all the games that I would be able to play. And yet I was full of apprehensions.

I saw some students walking around. They seemed to be quite indifferent to me. A few even stared at me insolently. It frightened me. How would I get along with these students? At that time the class teacher of my class came out of the Principal’s room. She took me to my class, introduced me to the students, asked a student to give a seat to me and told me that I should sit there every day. That student did not even say ‘hello’ to me. All my apprehensions came to fore. I felt very alone and stupid. 

Then the bell rang. The teacher left the class. Some five-six students crowded round me asking my name telling theirs, making fun of each other and pulling each other’s legs. Soon I was one of them. What I considered their aloofness was just discipline. How could they talk in front of the teacher! Now I love my school.
