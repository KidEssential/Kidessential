# Kidessential

Kidessential is a educational video, game, and activity site for kids in kindergarten . The main page is divided into math, language and reading, science and health. First, kids choose one of these subjects. When they click the subject, it gets broken into more specific categories. Under each category, individual video topic pages appear.

Bold, colorful graphics and punchy music on kidessential should be inviting to young kids. There are also tons of printable activities, games, and quizzes (easy or hard, printable or online) that help round out the experience. Furthermore, kids who struggle with reading can get added support, as videos and activities are audio- and visual-heavy.
