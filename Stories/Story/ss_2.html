He said: “Dear friend, some wild dogs are chasing me. Can you chase them away with your sharp antlers?” Dear said: “That is right, I can. But now I am busy. Why don’t you ask bear for help?”</p>
          <p class="bodyText2">Bunny rabbit ran to the bear. “My dear friend you are very strong, please help me. Some wild dogs are after me. Please chase them away,” he requested the bear.</p>
          <p class="bodyText2">Bear replied: “I am sorry. I am hungry and tired. I need to find some food. Please ask the monkey for help”.</p>
