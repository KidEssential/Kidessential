The weather was freezing. A group of monkeys were on a tree. They were clinging to its branches. One of the monkeys said, “I wish we could find some fire. It will help us to keep warm”.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">Suddenly they noticed a flock of fireflies. One of the young monkeys thought it was fire.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">He caught a firefly. He put it under a dry leaf and started blowing at it.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">Some other monkeys also joined in his effort.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">A sparrow came flying to its nest. The monkeys were sitting on the same tree. She noticed what they were doing. The sparrow laughed. She said, “Hey silly monkeys that is a firefly, not real fire”.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">The sparrow continued: “I think all of you should take shelter in a cave”. The monkeys did not listen to the sparrow. They continued to blow at our poor firefly.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">After some time the monkeys became very tired. Now they realized what the sparrow had said was correct.</p>
              <p class="bodyText2">They set free the firefly and moved to a nearby cave.</p>
