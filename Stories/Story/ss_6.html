Harry, Cornelius, Monty and I were busy building a snowman when Fritz appeared with his little niece Emily and introduced her.<br />
                “Emily is from the South and has never seen snow before,” Fritz told us. “She doesn’t know much about our winters.”<br />
                It turned out Emily also didn’t know much about Christmas.”Who is Santa Claus, Waldo?” she asked me, shivering in the cold air.<br />
              </p>
              <p class="bodyText2">“Santa Claus,” I explained, “brings presents and toys to human children at Christmas time.”<br />
                “Does he also bring presents to animal children?” Emily asked.<br />
                <img src="images/short_stories_ChristmasSurprise_2.jpg" alt="Short Stories - Christmas Surprise_Pic2" width="241" height="176" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />“Well,” I said, “he hasn’t been around this part of the forest for many years. I guess he is too busy visiting all the human children to have much time left for animals.”<br />
                “Do you think he will come if I write to him?” Emily asked.<br />
                “I don’t think so,” said Monty. “I’ve never seen him, myself.”<br />
                “Neither have I,” Harry added, shaking his head.<br />
                “You see. Santa Claus is only for human children,” Fritz said to Emily. “So forget about the whole idea. Let’s go home now before you catch a cold.”</p>
