              <p class="bodyText2">Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them but still failed. </p>
              <p class="bodyText2"><img src="images/short_stories_foxandgrapes3.jpg" alt="Short Stories" width="236" height="176" align="right" />Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, &quot;They're probably sour anyway,&quot; and proceeded to walk away.</p>
