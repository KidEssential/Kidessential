        <strong>Moral Stories - The Camel, The Jackal and The Crow</strong>

In a far off forest, there lived a lion named Madotkata served 

by a leopard, a jackal and a crow. One day they sighted 

Kradanaka, a camel who lost his way. Thinking the camel they 

saw was an unusual animal, the lion asked his assistants to 

find out if he was a wild animal or domestic animal.
</p><img src="images/the-camel-the-jackal-and-crow-1.jpg" /><p>
The crow said that the camel was a domestic animal fit to be 

killed and eaten. Refusing to eat Kradanaka, the lion said:

“I shall not kill someone who came seeking hospitality. 

According to our elders, you cannot kill even an enemy who 

came trusting you. He who kills so commits the sin of killing 

hundred Brahmins. Assure him of safety and bring him to 

me.”
</p><p>
The three assistants brought the camel to the presence of the 

lion. On the lion asking the camel to relate his story, 

Kradanaka told him how he was part of a trade caravan and 

how he had lost his way. The lion told the camel, “Kradanaka, 

why do you go back to your village and become once again a 

beast of burden? Remain with us without any hesitation and 

feast on this tender grass.” Thereafter, the camel stayed on to 

live happily with the lion and his three assistants. 

</p><p>
One day, the lion was locked in a battle with an elephant. The 

tusker gored Madotkata and badly injured him. He became 

too weak to hunt. Without food he was in no position to do 

anything. Then, the lion asked the assistants to go out and 

look for some animal for his meal. "Bring the animal here. I 

will kill him somehow and provide food for you all,” said the 

lion.
</p><p>
The leopard, the jackal, and the camel looked everywhere for 

an animal but could not find anyone. The jackal told the crow 

aside:

“Friend, what is the use of wasting time like this? We have 

Kradanaka, our lord's loyal friend. Let us kill him and 

survive.” “That is fine. Yet we cannot kill him because our 

lord has assured him protection,” said the crow.”

“Leave it to me. I shall convince Madotkata to kill the camel. 

Wait here. I will meet the lord and get his permission,” said 

the jackal and left to meet the lion.
</p><p>
The jackal told his lord, “Oh, lord, we went to every nook and 

corner of the forest. We could not find a single animal. We 

are tired, weak and hungry. Since my lord is also in the same 

condition, I humbly suggest that we make a meal of this 

camel.”
</p><p>
Highly annoyed, the lion said, “You sinner, if you repeat these 

words, I shall first kill you. I have given him my word. How 

can I kill him? Haven't our elders said that no gift of land or 

cow or food is greater than the gift of an assurance?”
</p><p>
“You are right my lord. It is a sin to kill him who has your 

word. But if the camel voluntarily offers himself as food it is 

no sin to accept the offer. If he does not volunteer, you can 

kill anyone of us. You are hungry and close to your end. If we 

are not of use to you at this time what value have our lives? 

If anything undesirable happens to our lord, we will immolate 

ourselves.”
</p><p>
The jackal told the other two assistants, “Friends, our lord is 

in a pitiable condition. There is now no one to protect us 

from others. Instead of aimlessly searching the forest for 

food, let us offer our bodies to him. That will deliver us from 

the burden of debt. The servant who is witness to the helpless 

death of his master will go to hell.”
</p><p>
After the jackal's plea, all of them called on the lion with 

tears in their eyes. “What's the matter? Did you find an 

animal?” asked the lion.

“No, my lord. We searched every place, every inch of the 

forest. We are not lucky. We found nothing. But I request the 

lord to have me for his meal. That will mean two birds with 

one shot. The lord will survive and I will go to heaven. He 

who lays down his life to save his lord will have no rebirth,” 

said the crow.
</p><p>
It was now the turn of the jackal to show his loyalty. He said, 

“My friend, crow. Your body is too small to slake the hunger 

of my lord. It amounts to starving him and that is a sin. Get 

out of my way. I have to submit a plea to my lord.”
</p><p>
Addressing the lion, the jackal said, “Lord, I request you to 

have me for your meal and ensure me a place in heaven. The 

lord has rights of life and death over his servants. Therefore, 

it is no sin in exercising his rights.”
</p><p>
The leopard intervened and said, “You jackal, you are no 

great personality. Let me plead with the lord.” Addressing 

Madotkata, the leopard said, “Oh lord, let me give away my 

life to save your life. Please permit me to earn a permanent 

berth in heaven. My sacrifice will win fame for me on earth.”
</p><p>
All this set Kradanaka thinking, “All these servants of the lord 

have said what they wanted to say. Still, the lion did not kill 

anyone of them. Let me also offer to be the lord's food today. 

I am sure my friends will support me.' He then turned to the 

leopard and said, “What you have said is right and proper. But 

you are a carnivorous animal and belong to the same species 

as the master does. How can he kill you? Let me offer 

myself.”
</p><p>

The camel then came forward and requested the lion to have 

him for that day's meal. At once, the jackal and the leopard 

pounced on him tore him to pieces and all of them had a 

sumptuous feast.</p> </div>
